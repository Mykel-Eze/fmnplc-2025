                Wheat milling forms the financial backbone of our diversified company. FMN pioneered flour 
                milling in Nigeria when its first mill was commissioned at Apapa in 1962 with a grinding
                capacity of 500 metric tonnes of wheat per day. Today, the Apapa milling complex has a rated
                capacity of over 8,000 metric tons per day making it one of the largest single site mills in
                the world. All the mills are manned by a team of highly trained and skilled professionals 
                working at a high level of efficiency attested to by our ISO 9001:2008 accreditation 
                recognizing that our flour manufacturing facilities are world class and operate within an 
                internationally recognized Quality System. FMN had over the years made huge investments in 
                milling technology and human capital to sustain its pre-eminent position and maintain its 
                competitive advantage in the Nigerian flour milling industry.

                In its over six-decade history, FMN's flagship food brand, “Golden Penny”, continues to be
                one of the best known and the preferred brand amongst bakers, confectioneries and consumers
                in Nigeria. The “Golden Penny” basket of foods has now grown to include products such as
                semovita, masavita, pasta, noodles, refined sugar, margarine, vegetable oils, and a range
                of snacks and breakfast cereals, instantly recognizable in any Nigerian household.

                FMN's first investment outside Flour Milling was in BAGCO in 1978. BAGCO now a Division of
                FMN is a pace setter in woven polypropylene sack manufacturing. With its two giant plants
                at Lagos and Kano, it is by far the largest and supplier of choice to many industrial and
                agro-allied companies in Nigeria in the packaging of flour, cement, grains, salt, 
                detergent, fertilizer, merchandise, farm harvests, shopping, etc. The BAGCO brand
                which has succeeded in gaining international recognition has also entered the export market
                with some of its polymer bags going to the African Continent and as far as the United States
                of America.

              Another significant milestone was the company's foray into Cement. The company operated a
              large cement terminal at Apapa and marketed its cement under “Burham Cement” brand, renowned
              for high quality and consistency. The cement terminal had a handling capacity of 10,000 metric
              tonnes of cement per day. In line with Federal Government's backward integration policy, Flour
              Mills invested in the United Cement Manufacturing Co. Ltd. (UNICEM) Calabar, in 2002. UNICEM
              operates a green field, fully integrated cement plant, with a capacity of 2.5 million metric
              tonnes of cement per annum. In 2015, a strategic decision was made to dispose of the investment
              in UNICEM and refocus the group as a publicly traded, Food and Agro-Allied company that strives
              to use locally sourced materials to develop and produce unique consumer products for the local
              markets.

              Beyond wheat based products, FMN Group's strategic imperative in the years ahead is to create
              value in the supply chain and reduce dependence on imported raw materials. To this end, FMN has
              recently invested billions of Naira in its agro-allied ventures. The Group's strategic
              diversification into agribusiness began in 1978 with the investment in a 10,000ha Kaboji
              Farm, which is close to the town of Kontagora in Niger State. We have subsequently made many
              other significant investments in primary processing of locally grown soybean, palm
              fruit, cassava, maize, and sugar cane; storage, aggregation and distribution of locally sourced
              grains and export commodities; manufacture, and distribution of agro-inputs, such as seeds and
              fertilizers. These strategic investments across the major crop value chains are setting the pace
              for others to follow and continue to strengthen our position as Nigeria's Premier Food and
              Agro-Allied Company.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-base">
              To ensure the continued viability and sustainability of our Food and Agro-Allied operations in a
              challenging business environment, we have also invested heavily in support services in the form
              of manufacturing and marketing of packaging materials; power generation; ground transport
              logistics; and port operations; which include shipping, customs clearing, forwarding, and a
              shipping agency.

              Indeed, FMN Group is continuously exploring opportunities for strategic partnerships to 
              grow and enhance competitive positioning in its main line of business in Nigeria and at a 
              future date extend its investment and business activities beyond the borders of Nigeria.
