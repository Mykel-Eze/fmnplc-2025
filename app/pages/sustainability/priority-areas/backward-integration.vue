                FMN PLC has invested more than N150 billion over the past ten years to execute its core
                business strategy to aid the agricultural sector. This investment has been made primarily
                in Agriculture and Infrastructure.

              <p>
                Volatile commodity prices arising from unpredictable changes in global supply and
                demand, exchange rate fluctuations and punitive tariffs and import barriers, has made our
                reliance on imported raw materials risky, expensive and unsustainable. The need to create
                value further back in the supply chain and reduce dependence on imported raw material has
                been identified as a strategic imperative for our Group in the years ahead. The investment
                of the next N150 billion will, therefore, focus on a strategy of backward integration to
                maintain growth and sustained profitability.

                Raw materials will be produced locally wherever possible to ensure that good quality fair
                value products are developed through the full supply chain from growing to final consumer
                consumption - from farm to fork.
